# go-quaerere

Quaerere
: (Latin)

## Purpose

The Quaerere Platform aims to be a platform to conduct a variety of data science experiments on a managed set of data.
The first goal is to establish a common way of storing and accessing whatever data we may be interested in. A first
draft of this was originally accomplished using Python.

## Components
### kootenay
Kootenay is the name of the largest lake in the Pacific Northwest, and this app is a manager of a data lake. It aims to
be a common access layer for data, currently using ArangoDB as the storage backend with additional backends possibly
added at a later time.
